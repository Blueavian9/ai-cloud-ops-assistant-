## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses **RAG** architecture (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

1. Upload cloud documents (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
2. The app indexes them using **FAISS** vector search.
3. Ask your cloud ops question in natural language.
4. The AI retrieves relevant docs and generates a clear, contextual response.
